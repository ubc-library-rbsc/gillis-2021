## Homesickness

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Only just over a month passed between the declaration of war on Japan by Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King, and the Order in Council that began to strip Japanese Canadians of their homes, livelihoods, and property. By spring of 1942, most families were already being sent against their will to various internment sites and sugar beet farms across the country.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Because of how quickly this uprooting took place, we can see in the correspondents’ earliest letters with Joan their individual ways of coping with the loss of their homes, their communities, and their safety.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Many correspondents expressed a great longing for British Columbia; for most of them, New Westminster and the areas surrounding it were the only home they had ever known. Weather comparisons and romantic descriptions of West Coast landscapes can be found in a number of the letters.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">For others, this homesickness was more closely tied to their school community at Queen Elizabeth Secondary. Joan received frequent requests for copies of the school newspaper, the <i>Q.E. Vue</i>, in addition to updates on teachers and the results of school sporting events. One correspondent, Yoshio Nakamura, spends the first six months of 1944 requesting that Joan send a school pin. When Joan is able to finally fulfill this request, Yoshio reminisces about their shared time at school and compares his years pulled away from home to those of a soldier fighting on foreign soil.</p>

It brought me back to the time I shook hands with you on that last day at school. Gosh, but I wish I could live those years over again. I feel like a soldier away on a foreign shore fighting in battles, and thinking the peaceful hours spent before the tragic occurance [sic]. Thank you an awful lot Joan, for the pin. I won't forget it."</p></blockquote>

## Making a Home

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Though assignment to sugar beet farms was framed by the federal government to be a choice that afforded Japanese Canadians the “privilege” of keeping their families together, the number of members in a family who were old enough to work in the fields was a large consideration for the farmers who selected which families to employ.<sup>1</sup> However, the housing provided by these farmers was often no more than a single-room storage shed. The B.C. Security Commission, who enforced the dispersal of Japanese Canadians and the non-consensual sales of their property, provided some additional lumber for makeshift extensions to farm homes, but only distributed it to the land-owning farmers.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Housing conditions came as a shock to many of Joan’s correspondents, particularly for those whose families had owned their own farms or businesses in B.C. Jackie Takahashi describes his new quarters as a “wee shack” of “10’ by 20’”, with no room for anyone to move.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Not too far from Jackie was Sumi Mototsune, who was sent to live and work on a sugar beet farm near Raymond, Alberta, with her parents, three sisters, and one brother. In a letter from May 30th, 1942, she says of her family's one-room home, “Only mice can have the pleasure of living in here.”</p>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Despite the many difficulties of their new living conditions, we can see the ways that the correspondents and their loved ones fought to build a home. Sumi and her mother ask Joan for flower seeds from British Columbia to populate their home garden. Not long after the comment about only mice enjoying their home, Sumi also writes that her father is crafting a second-room extension to improve their house for their family.</p>
	
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">In a much later letter from 1947, Jackie Takahashi notes that he is moving to Brooks, Alberta, to pursue better career opportunities but is hesitant to leave Magrath, the town which had become his home and which he notes is one of the only places in Alberta to grant Japanese Canadians municipal voting rights. He says, "I think when you get to know a place for a while you start to like it even if it is a dead place. Magrath is just a small store on a road but now I hate to leave it."<sup>4</sup></p>

## Recreation

<div class="container">

    <div class="col-md-6 my-auto">
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Between recollections of backbreaking labour in the beet fields and experiences of discrimination in their new environments, it can be difficult to remember that most of the letter-writers in this exhibit are just teenagers. One of the greatest reminders of the young age of these correspondents, and a reflection of their resilience in spite of ongoing systemic racism, is the enthusiasm with which they write to Joan about their hobbies, passions, and the activities they turn to for fun.</p>
	    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Sports games against rival schools are recounted point by point. The same dance socials are discussed by multiple correspondents, with palpable awkwardness and excitement. Accounts of weekend trips to go swimming and skating at the lakes are written in startling detail. Below, Albert Ohama writes about one of his favourite singers, Bing Crosby.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Correspondents send detailed lists of films seen and songs recently heard on the airwaves to Joan. Perhaps more important than entertainment, these films and radio programs represented cultural links to home, a way of relating to a community of which they could no longer physically be a part.</p>
